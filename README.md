Abstract—Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a brain disorder that
causes progressive cognitive decline in older adults. It slowly
destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually the ability
to carry out the simplest task. Alzheimer’s patients experience
changes in behavior and personality. There is currently no cure
for AD. Although few medicines are approved, those work best
for the early and middle stage patients of AD. As the aging
population is growing, the occurrence of AD is steadily increasing.
This is showing the urgent necessity for early diagnosis and
intervention. Additionally, identifying symptoms early enables
timely therapeutic intervention, aiding in symptom management
and enhancing their quality of life. AD is notorious for gradually
eroding memory and cognitive abilities, underscoring the pivotal
yet challenging nature of early detection and management. In
this project our aim is to develop a tool by harnessing the
power of machine learning and deep learning to filter through
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images for detecting the
early signs of AD. We utilized the Open Access Series of Imaging
Studies (OASIS) dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprising MRI
brain images, to train and validate our developed model. We
employed various models, including Random Forest and Logistic
Regression from shallow learning techniques, as well as Extra
Trees from ensemble learning. Additionally, we leveraged Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning model, in our
analysis. While it’s apparent that Deep Learning, particularly
CNNs, may yield superior performance, we also explore whether
comparable results can be achieved through shallow or ensemble
learning approaches. We conducted evaluations using different
metrics, including common ones such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and AUC for all models. Additionally, we specifically
calculated training and validation accuracy and loss for the CNN
model. Extra Trees and CNN demonstrated nearly comparable
performance, with CNN achieving the highest Accuracy and AUC
scores, while Extra Trees excelled in precision and recall metrics.
